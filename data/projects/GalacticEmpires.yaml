description: The project [Galactic Empires](https://github.com/Zephilinox/GalacticEmpires) was meant to be a 4x space game made in C\+\+ with SFML, CEGUI, Thor, Lua, and LuaBridge. Development stopped shortly after due to the realisation of the huge scope of such a project and the lack of experience to finish it. Features Lua Integration, CEGUI Integration, State Management, and A\* Pathfinding on a Hexagonal Grid.
