I built a C++17 header-only [Threadpool](https://github.com/Zephilinox/Threadpool) library with 4 different compile time configuration options (policies). Uses various standard
multithreading functions (mutex, promise, condition variable, atomic). Features unit tests, Github Actions CI/CD, and benchmarks.
