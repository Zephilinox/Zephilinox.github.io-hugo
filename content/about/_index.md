My name is Ricardo Heath. I'm studying at University of the West of England for Games Technology. I mostly program in C++17 but have exposure to multiple languages.

You can find my Res(fancy U)me here (include link here). The best way of contacting me is via email, which can be found at the top of my Res(fancy U)me. I have some (somewhat) finished projects which can be found on github, as well as a few minor FOSS contributions.

My dissertation will be creating a high-level API in C++17 for an entity scene-graph that abstracts and automates networking, such as implementing RPC's. This blog will document some of my thought processes and work toward that end.
