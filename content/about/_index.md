My name is Ricardo Heath. I've finished my studies at the University of the West of England for Games Technology. I mostly program in C++17 but have exposure to multiple languages.

You can find my Résumé [here](
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ivFccs5jylJk1owtL1JpQ6qnXj-RWwnh). The best way of contacting me is via email, which can be found at the top of my Résumé. I have some projects which can be found on github as well as on this website, and a few minor FOSS contributions.

My dissertation was creating a high-level API in C++17 for an entity scene-graph that abstracts and automates networking, such as implementing RPC's. You can find it [here](../projects/enkinet/)
