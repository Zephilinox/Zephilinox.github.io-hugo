As part of a university module "game jam" we "demade" splatoon in to a retro version over a couple of days. I worked with a team of a few others to create it, in which I handled technical features such as the painting mechanic, and making it multithreaded to ensure smooth gameplay, as well as the weapons themselves and some other player functionality.

This splatoon demake is a 1v1 game, blue vs red, using bullets, bombs, and walking to paint the arena. Like in classic splatoon, covering the arena in your colour allows you to win.
