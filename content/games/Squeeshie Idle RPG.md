I used Go to make a discord Idle RPG Game called Squeeshie Idle RPG. It was only used amongst friends and never released, though I plan to come back and continue its development. It uses Go with the Discord websocket API via https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo. User data is saved as JSON to a Postgres database. It was hosted on GCP and also has integrations with Prometheus, Grafana, and Alert monitoring
