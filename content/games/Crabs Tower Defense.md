As part of a university module "game jam" myself and a few others in my team were given a random theme from a generator and had to make a game based on it within two weeks. That theme was fondling crabs in an underground bunker. I was primarily responsible for the enemies, pathing with splines, and one of the maps, while also helping out generally.
