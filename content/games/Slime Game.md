For a university module myself and a friend made a 3D platformer in Unity in which you fight slimes, ultimately fighting the slime king. I was responsible for the Slimes and their combat system, UI, pickups, the [platform system](../projects/platform-system), one of the levels, shaders, lighting, and other various scripts and systems.
