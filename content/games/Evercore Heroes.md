- C++17 and UE5 with a focus on Multiplayer and the Gameplay Ability System (GAS) for Heroes, Enemies, and Combat
- Pioneered the design and implementation of a parenting system for Ability System Components, enabling seamless GameplayEffect redirection based on the instigators actions. This played a critical role in creating shared raid bosses for multiple competing teams and enabling interactive and competitive elements
- Many various contributions and fixes to UI, Animation Blueprints, AI Perception & Targeting systems, our bespoke movement system using RVO, Materials (shaders), and more, while aiding and supporting team members, producers, designers, and artists

After a failed launch followed by layoffs, the games scope was reduced and redesigned a co-operative roguelike experience, now rebranded as "Evercore Heroes: Ascension"
