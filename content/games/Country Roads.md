For Global Game Jam 19 I joined up with a few of friends and made [Country Roads](https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2019/games/country-road) using Unity, a local party game for up to 4 players in which the goal is to get home. I did a lot of little tasks but I was primarily responsible for the end-of-game grave system, the menu, and gamepad control system.
