[Cowboys](https://github.com/Zephilinox/Cowboys) is a networked, turn-based startegy game where you control a team of 5 different cowboys and battle it out against another player. Written in C++17 for a university module. I was primarily responsible for creating the networking system and other engine architecture, such as multiple audio backends, state manager, message queue, and signal & slots.
