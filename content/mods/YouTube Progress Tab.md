built an extension to solve an ever-present personal problem of mine. It lets me find which of many dozens of open youtube tabs had videos I had partially watched before moving on. You can find it for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/youtube-progress-tab/) and [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youtube-progress-tab/bihgbcflichfnkgibnakaeehnkmjpnbm) (did you know you have to pay google a registration fee to upload extensions?)
