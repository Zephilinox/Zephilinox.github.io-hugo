[Make-A-Warforged](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/r1uX6ULDZ) is a homebrew race for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition, with a unique design that allows players to customise their warforged character without overpowering those of other players. It has been viewed over 15,000 times.

It is the most popular warforged on /r/unearthedarcana, a subreddit dedicated to homebrew for DnD 5e. It solved a lot of the issues from previous attempts at creating a warforged race, such as lackluster thematics or overpowered armor, something the official play-test material struggles at.
