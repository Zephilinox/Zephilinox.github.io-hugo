I created [Improved Chat](http://www.trovesaurus.com/mod=1020/improved-chat), the first mod for the MMORPG Trove that modified game logic by using [RABCDAsm](https://github.com/CyberShadow/RABCDAsm) to dissassemble and reassemble Actionscript files used for the client-side UI of the Chat System, by editing raw ASM.

This mod made a variety of improvements to the default Trove Chat UI such as clearer colours and an expanded view. It led the way for other modders within the community to create mods with access to the client-side code. At its peak it was in the top 5 mods for Trove with over 2,000 downloads.
