I created a [Deathcam](https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?topic=282550.0) script for Mount & Blade Warband and released it to the community. It has been used in a variety of complete overhaul mods such as [Gekokujo](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=285786182), [Perisno](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=316610148), and [Nova Aetas](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=498482336) (ranked \#3, \#6, and \#9 on Steam Workshop for most subscribed Warband Mods, respectively)
